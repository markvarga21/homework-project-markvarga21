# Stone game
We place 16 stones (circles) to a 4x4 table, to each cell. The players can alternately remove minimum 1, and maximum 4
stones (circles) from the board. The removable stones have to be all together in the same row/same column and there
cannot be empty board cell between them. Who makes the last move, loses.
